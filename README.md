## Hi!
### I'm Cara
##### Here's some stuff about me:
1. I have a 20 gallon fish tank for a singular betta fish.
2. My family has 3 dogs that we all rescued/foster failed.
3. I consider coming up with facts about myself a stressful activity.

And just for fun... Here's a link to [my current portfolio website](www.carabortnem.com) which will hopefully look a lot different by the time this semester is over :)
